Import necessary libraries and modules:

YOLO for object detection using Ultralytics.
Other modules for file operations, calculations, and image manipulation.
Initialize YOLO model and define input and output folders:

Load the YOLOv8 pre-trained model.
Specify the folder containing input images and the folder where grouped images will be saved.
Define a function to get the list of files in a folder:

This function uses os.walk to traverse through a folder and return a list of file names.
Define the main function to detect segments in images:

For each image in the input folder:
Predict objects using YOLO model.
Count entities using count_Entities.
Group images using group_images.
Write entity counts to a CSV using write_to_CSV.
Count entities in YOLO detection results:

Iterate through YOLO results for each image.
Count the occurrences of different entities and the total number of objects.
Write entity counts to a CSV file:

Create a CSV file path based on the image name.
Write entity names, counts, and total objects to the CSV file.
Calculate structural similarity between two images:

Convert images to grayscale using PIL.
Calculate SSIM using skimage's structural_similarity function.
Group images based on entity counts and similarity:

Create folders for each entity detected in the image.
Compare current group folder with the similar_folder.
If the folders are different, move non-similar images to separate folders.
In the main section, call the detect_Segments function to initiate the image processing and grouping.
